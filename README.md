## 🌐💬 QnA
### Q: How do I upgrade to PRO+
#### A: When PRO+ is released you can buy them in ROBLOX Marketplace, and we will link it to our README
### Q: Why is there an expiry in 0.0.1 LITE
#### A: Since 0.0.1 is not been fully released so there is an expiry to keep you updated when we release the 0.0.2 VERSION, and also 0.0.1 LITE only has 3 features, not like 0.0.2 Version has 7 features to use
